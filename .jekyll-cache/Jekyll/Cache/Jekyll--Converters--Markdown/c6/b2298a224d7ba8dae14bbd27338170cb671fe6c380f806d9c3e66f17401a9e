<p>Hello visitors!</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my new website!</p>

<p>Now I know this may not be the cleanest website, but I am no web developer. However, if you have any advice on how I could improve the page, please feel free to contact me!</p>

<p>I am hoping to post some blog posts related to some of the work I have done, so you can look forward to seeing some new posts related to my senior project. This is also a place for me to write about some of my discoveries in the field of computer science and any of the struggles I come across.</p>

<p>I would like to give a special shoutout to Ariyana for answering all of my questions related to web development and helping me through all of my confusion. After she gets that domain name, she is taking off. I know it.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>
