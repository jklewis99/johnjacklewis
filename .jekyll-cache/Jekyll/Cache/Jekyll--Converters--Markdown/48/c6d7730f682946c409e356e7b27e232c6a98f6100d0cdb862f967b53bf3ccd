I"N<p>Mentorship is one of the most invaluable aspects of intellectual growth. Part of its beauty is derived from its universality, how it is evidently relevant across all academic fields. Society is generally full of this theme: in a philosophy course, often times the first thing you learn is how Aristotle was a student of Plato and Plato a student of Socrates. Time and time again, you see actors learning from other actors or directors learning from other directors or authors learning from other authors ‚Äì just someone learning from someone.</p>

<p>This, of course, is incredibly important, but I have found that the way it is crafted and encouraged is frequently detrimental to me and likely others. Specifically, I find it problematic to encourage students to <em>look</em> for a mentor or for mentors to be <em>assigned</em>.</p>

<p>For too long, I was finding myself disappointed when someone I thought would be my mentor failed me. But it was not because they were a bad mentor; it was because I had defined my expectations, or they had based me on others. I had framed them in a box, or they had me. Instead, the most valuable mentors were ones I wasn‚Äôt specifically seeking out.</p>

<p>In my first year of college, I was looking to work hard, get good grades, and discover how I could translate my passions into a career. I was not looking for a resident advisor who taught me a whole new perspective and provided me a resource to figure out campus and college. I was not looking for a professor who would convert my lack of confidence into a leadership role. However, these people for whom I was not actively looking turned out to be the most influential mentors in my first year of college. Because of my resident advisor, I found the value in introspection, the value in individualism, the value in taking care of the environment and the people within it. Because of my professor, I gained confidence in myself, learned how to find the answers to my questions, learned how to contribute to a team. These revelations were not about college or code or any of the bullet points I often see listed for mentoring relationships. They were just about life.</p>

<p>And my goal here is not to get preachy nor to tell anyone that ‚Äúthings happen for a reason‚Äù (because I certainly do not subscribe to that philosophy). I am more asking,</p>

<p><em>Should we reconsider the frame?</em></p>

<p>I want people to encourage students of computer science, even those who have been in the industry for years, that mentorship and leadership is rarely about the computer science. My generation is one of short attention spans because we see the world around us crumbling into incontrollable chaos and self-destruction. We want to escape this reality and meticulously craft a virtual personality. As the world moves remote, we won‚Äôt know how to engage these people because, frankly, we know nothing about each other.</p>

<p>If we cannot feel safe sarcastically bickering‚Ä¶ If we don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing our stories of the weekend‚Ä¶ If we only come to talk about <em>programming</em>‚Ä¶ then we too are just algorithms in the workplace, where we spend more time per week than we do get time sleeping.</p>

<p>So when we want to improve retention at a college or a company, we need to do better in understanding how we are connecting new individuals with experienced associates. But we can‚Äôt ask the question, <em>Should we reconsider the frame?</em> until we ask the individuals, <em>Who are you</em> or, even better than asking, <em>discover who they are.</em></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs normalize going axe throwing or playing table tennis or recreational sports or any of the things that people who are not me like to do with our colleagues <strong>before</strong> we assign mentors and their pupils.</p>

<p>Time is too valuable to be spent lying about what we have in common and hiding what we love.</p>
